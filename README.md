"# WatchYourBack" <br>
This alarm app's main purpose is to remind the user that he/she should keep his/her back straight while sitting in front of a computer. 
3 different types of notifications can be chosen (pop-up window with "motivational" stock image, sound and tray notification). Minimum and maximum time can be set between occurrences of two notifications of the same type (exact time will be calculated randomly), each notification type has its own timer, so they can go off independently from each other.

This app helps me a lot with maintaining acceptable sitting position. You should try it!

Java features used in the project:
*Timer, new Threads
*Swing (IntelliJ Idea build-in creator)
